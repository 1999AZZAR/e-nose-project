# e-nose (electronic nose)

## Definition
An electronic nose, also known as an "artificial nose" or "e-nose", is a device that uses sensor arrays and pattern recognition systems to detect and classify odors or flavors. It is designed to mimic the human sense of smell by reproducing the ability to distinguish between different odors.

## Abstract
- Electronic noses are being developed as frameworks for the automated discovery and classification of odors, vapors, and gasses. 
- An electronic nose is composed of a chemical sensing framework (e.g., sensor cluster or spectrometer) and a pattern recognition framework (e.g., artificial neural network). The chemical sensing framework detects the chemical compounds in the air, while the pattern recognition framework analyzes the data and identifies the odor.
- We are creating electronic noses for various applications such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and food quality control.

## Introduction
1. The two main components of an electronic nose are:
   - the chemical sensing framework: This component can be made up of multiple different sensing components (e.g., chemical sensors), a single sensing device (e.g., spectrometer), or a combination of both. The chemical sensing framework detects the chemical compounds in the air and produces an output signal.
   - the pattern recognition framework: This component analyzes the output signal from the chemical sensing framework and identifies the odor. It can be a software algorithm or a neural network.
2. When a chemical vapor is presented to the sensor array, it produces a unique output signal that is characteristic of that chemical. By presenting multiple different chemicals to the sensor array, a database of patterns is established. 
3. This database of labeled patterns is used to train the pattern recognition framework. 
4. The objective of this training process is to develop a unique classification of each chemical so that an automated identification can be implemented.
5. The amount and complexity of the data collected by the sensor array can make traditional chemical analysis of the data in an automated manner difficult. One approach to chemical vapor identification is to construct an array of sensors, where each sensor within the array is designed to respond to a specific chemical. With this approach, the number of unique sensors must be at least as great as the number of chemicals being detected. However, it can be both costly and difficult to construct highly specific chemical sensors.
6. The electronic nose can be used in various fields such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and food quality control.
   - In environmental monitoring, electronic noses can be used to detect and classify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air. These VOCs can be emitted from industrial processes, vehicle exhausts, and other sources and can have negative effects on human health and the environment.
   - In medical diagnosis, electronic noses can be used to detect and classify odors from breath, skin, or other bodily fluids. These odors can be used to diagnose diseases such as lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, and diabetes.
   - In food quality control, electronic noses can be used to detect and classify odors from food products. These odors can be used to determine the freshness, quality, and authenticity of the food.

Overall, electronic noses have the potential to revolutionize the way we detect and classify odors in various fields.
